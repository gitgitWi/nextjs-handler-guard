# Next.js Handler Guard

## Philosophy

- Next.js is fullstack framework, but it has **poor support for api handlers**. Next.js doesn't have native guards, filters or validators for http methods, query strings, cookies, and so on... It is very **contrast to what Nest.js does**.
- **FP paradigm**. Nest.js support request lifecycle with decorators on OOP paradigm, but decorator still in experimental stage, so not a few developer have resistance to it.
